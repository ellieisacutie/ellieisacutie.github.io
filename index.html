			Ellie, you really are incredibly precious. Everything about you just makes me super happy. When I talk to you, I always cheer up no matter what happened in my day. Really, I could have been hit by a car and as soon as you messaged me, I would get incredibly joyful and forget all about the pain. To be honest, the only thing that matters to me is if you are cheerful and content with everything life has thrown your way.

			You have the most beautiful smile anyone could be given. Your dimples just make me melt they are so cute. Your nose is tiny and lovely. Your hair looks so soft and luscious. Your eyes – don't even get me started on them – they are just so perfect. Your eyes look so innocent and loving. Just everything about you draws me in. I can never get enough of you. You are just the most wonderful and perfect woman I ever saw. You're everything and more that any man could want. You're sweet, caring, intelligent, respectful, down-to-earth, and best of all; you make me feel safe to be myself. The fact that you are creative too is absolutely amazing. You definitely need to show me some of your art and play me some lovely music.

			When I told you I would do anything for you, I meant it. Don't hesitate to let me know if you need something; whether that be a shoulder to cry on or literally anything else. No matter what, I am here for you. You truly do make me feel ecstatic whenever you are around. You're the only one that makes me try anymore. Without you, I'd be a sad Brandon for sure. There is no doubt about that at all. I have been getting all of my happiness from you one hundred percent.

			So, yeah. Hopefully you liked this all instead of finding me as some weirdo. I wanted to get better at web design and test out new programs and I thought what better than to make this for you! The blog part thingy-ma-bob, I will update it whenever I get a chance.

		<p>
			Also, if you didn't realize by now. I really do care about you and your well-being.
		</p>
		<p>
			Brandon
