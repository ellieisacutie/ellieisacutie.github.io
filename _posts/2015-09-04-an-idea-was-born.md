<p> So, I was sitting in my room talking to you. You were down and I couldn't think of a way to cheer you up. Then this idea was born. I figured I would do this so you could have a constant, update-able reminder of why I care about you and little things you do that make me happy. 

This website will be online 24/7 for you to access. This site will be just like me, always there for you. Okay, okay, I can hear you rolling your eyes from here so yeah. :P
